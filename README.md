This project aims to propose a possible solution for doors incapable of being open under emergencies involving high temperatures with the development of a device named ESL (Emergency Smart Lock). In which using the electronic prototyping platform Arduino, a servo motor and a temperature sensor, along with tools like software and hardware, is intended to reach the development of the prototype. The development of the prototype was segmented in different phases, since the early phases, of planning, studying the possible ways to do the automation proposed and the platforms Tinkercad and Arduino, selecting the most suited components, constructing the structure, fixating the components previously mentioned and setting a general picture of the electronic circuit. To the later phases, of the development of the source-code to be written and executed by the arduino and, finally, the phase of practical tests. The test of the prototype was made in a small wooden door, in which a metal trench was inserted. The servomotor that was activated by the temperature sensor, obtaining, then, good results, opened the trench. Finally, it was possible to understand, among others, the functionality of the hardware and software platforms utilized, beyond the acquisition of brief knowledge in the area of electronics, that gains, by each day, more importance in our contemporary world.
